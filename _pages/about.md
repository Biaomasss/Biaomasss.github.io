Biao Ma was born in a small village in Zhumadian, Henan Province in 1992. He pursued his undergraduate studies in applied chemistry at Dalian Jiaotong University (2014) and went on to obtain his M.S. in analytical chemistry from Northeastern University (2017, Supervisor: Prof. Zhi-Yong Wu). He furthered his academic journey by earning a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering from Southeast University at Nanjing (2020, Supervisor: Prof. Hong Liu). Biao is currently a ‘Zhishan’ postdoc at the School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering of Southeast University. Driven by curiosity, Biao is deeply passionate about cool science discoveries and creating innovative technologies. His current research interest is creating smart matter-based biosensors and bioelectronics for healthcare, or just for fun, by using his multidisciplinary research experiences in chemistry, materials science, microfabrication, electrochemistry, microfluidics, and device integration. He has published 28 peer-reviewed articles, several of which have been featured in high-impact journals such as Science Advances, Nature Reviews Bioengineering, Advanced Functional Materials, and Lab on a Chip.
